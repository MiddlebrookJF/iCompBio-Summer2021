# iCompBio-Worksheets
Jupyter Notebook projects for UTC iCompBio REU - Analyzing SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein - Worksheets

Created 05/24/2021
This repository was made with the purpose of keeping track of present and future Jupyter notebook files that will be used for the computational research required by the project. It has now been expanded to include more of the project - everything except for the C# code contained in SpikeProteinProject. This change was brought about by the need to remedy the 6zge.csv file, which contained about 14,000 extraneous lines of null values which the Worksheet1 execution was attempting to process.
