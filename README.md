This repository was made with the purpose of keeping track all files that are used for the computational research required by the project. It is a part of the UTC Summer 2021 iCompBio Research Undergraduate Experience and is the work of Jason Middlebrook and mentor Professor Eleni Panagiotou. The focus is on the topological measurement known as the second Vassiliev measure and how it can be used to determine changes in structure to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and related proteins, and determine the importance of specific areas within their domains. Most of the code consists of Python files in the Worksheets and ClusterPyFiles folders, whereas the Vas-Data folder has a majority of the output.
