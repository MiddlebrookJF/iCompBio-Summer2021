This repository was made with the purpose of keeping track all files that are used for the computational research required by the project. This project is on the topological measurement known as the second Vassiliev measure and how it can be used to determine changes in structure to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and related proteins, and determine the importance of specific areas within the domains of these proteins. This work is with Dr. Eleni Panagiotou for the UTC Summer 2021 iCompBio Research Undergraduate Experience. Most of the code consists of Python files in the Worksheets and ClusterPyFiles folders, whereas the Vas-Data folder has a majority of the output.
